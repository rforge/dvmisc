\title{Faster Computation of Common Statistics and Miscellaneous Functions}
\description{
Faster versions of base R functions (e.g. mean, standard deviation, 
covariance, weighted mean), mostly written in C++, along with miscellaneous 
functions for various purposes (e.g. create histogram with fitted probability 
density function or probability mass function curve, create body mass index 
groups, assess linearity assumption in logistic regression).
