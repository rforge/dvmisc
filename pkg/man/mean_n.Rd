\title{Mean of Numeric Values}
\usage{
mean_n(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector or matrix.}
}
\value{
Numeric value.
}
\description{
Defined simply as \code{sum(x) / length(x)}, this function seems to always 
run faster than \code{\link[base]{mean}} for numeric, non-integer 
vectors/matrices. For integer objects, \code{\link{mean_i}} should run even 
faster.
}
\examples{
# In general, mean_n is much faster than mean.
x <- rnorm(10000)
mean(x) == mean_n(x)
benchmark(mean(x), mean_n(x), replications = 1000)

# For very large integer objects, mean may be faster than mean_n. But then 
# mean_i should be even faster.
x <- rpois(100000, lambda = 5)
mean(x) == mean_n(x)
mean(x) == mean_i(x)
benchmark(mean(x), mean_n(x), mean_i(x), replications = 1000)
